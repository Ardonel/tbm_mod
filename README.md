# Repo for my TBM Reloaded Mod

Tunnel boring machine.

This mod adds a tunnel boring machine that can be used to make tunnels underground,
or if you are lazy, you can use it to pave your in-game superhighway.

This mod has ideas and code from aldobr, Dan Duncombe, Arcanus, kpoppel, and Ardonel.

Also added is a carbon-diamond pickaxe as an additional tool.
